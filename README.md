# Machine Learning Projects
This is my ML course project and my personal experiments using ML
## [Brain Events Prediction via WaveNet Using RAW EEG Features](https://github.com/mariazhou668899/ML/tree/main/EEG_Analysis_WaveNet)
This notebook explores using WaveNet to predict brain events based on raw EEG waveforms. The main objective is to assess how effectively WaveNet can learn patterns in brain activity from minimal EEG features.
