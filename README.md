# ML Projects
This is my ML course project and my personal experiments using ML
## [EEG Data Analysis with Wavenet](https://github.com/mariazhou668899/ML/tree/main/EEG_Analysis_WaveNet)
This notebook explores using WaveNet to predict brain events based on raw EEG waveforms in Kaggle's Brain competition. The main objective is to assess how effectively WaveNet can learn patterns in brain activity from minimal EEG features. 


## [Cuisines Clustering with KMeans/GMM/Hierarchy/DBSCAN](https://github.com/mariazhou668899/ML/tree/main/cuisine_kmeans_GMM_Hierarchy__DBSCAN)

## [Patient Appointment Show Up Prediction](https://github.com/mariazhou668899/ML/tree/main/patientAppointmentPrediction)
